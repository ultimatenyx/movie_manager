# Movie Manager
A PHP based mini application to make life easier and faster


This project began as a need to manage the list of downloaded Movies/TV serials. The first draft thought was that of the SCRUD based system, but looking into the time contraints and the unnecessary data entry involved, I decided to scrap it. 

As a result, this is the small solution that was developed. It is not exactly the best solution, but it does help in searching and locating movies to me.
